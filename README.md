Linux support for EC2 debugger from Silicon Laboritories
============

This is a fork from gson's ec2-newer(https://github.com/gson1703/ec2-newer) of 
paragonRobotics' fork (https://github.com/paragonRobotics/ec2-new) of
Ricky White's ec2drv (http://ec2drv.sourceforge.net).

paragonRobotics's fork lacks the original history from White, I add the history
and merge the available branches.

ChangeLog
-----------
- Clean up the code, remove unnecessary files.
