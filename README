This is gson's fork (https://github.com/gson1703/ec2-newer) of 
paragonRobotics' fork (https://github.com/paragonRobotics/ec2-new) of
Ricky White's ec2drv (http://ec2drv.sourceforge.net).

It adds portability fixes aimed at making ec2drv work non-Linux
systems in general, and NetBSD in particular.

The original README follows.

ec2drv provides Linux support for the Silicon Laboritories EC2 serial debug
adaptor.

newcdb provides a new GDB like interface for ec2drv but also for the s51
simulator.  This is more flexiable than ec2cdb / sdcdb in that it allows easy
configuration to the target to use.  Also the readline support works correctly
for history etc.

ec2cdb is my first attempt at a c debugger interface, basically a quick hack of
sdcdb replacing the calls to s51 with calls into ec2drv.  
At the moment I think newcdb is the better option since I have tested it more
but it is still missing some functionality.


ec2tools contains programs that use the core library to perform various actions.
	ec2test-any	- tast the opperation of a micro / debugger combination
	ec2readflash 	Read the targets flash memory.
	ec2writeflash 	Write to the targets flash memory.
	ec2device		Identify connected microprocessor
	ec3adapters		List all USB debug adaptors found and their serial numbers
					This is for both EC3 and toolstick debuggers.
	ec2readfw		Read teh debuggers firmware image
	ec2-update-fw	write new firmware into the debugger
